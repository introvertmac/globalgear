## Project Structure

- `pages/`: Contains Next.js pages and API routes.
- `components/`: Reusable React components.
- `context/`: React context providers for global state management.
- `config/`: Configuration files, including product data and Portal API settings.
- `styles/`: Global styles and Tailwind CSS configuration.

## Airtable Structure

The project uses Airtable for order management and history. The Airtable base consists of a single table with the following structure:

- `id`: Unique identifier for each order (Text)
- `customerEmail`: Email address of the customer (Email)
- `orderDate`: Date and time of the order (DateTime)
- `totalAmount`: Total amount of the order in PYUSD (Number)

- `shippingAddress`: JSON string containing the shipping address details (Long Text)
- `transactionHash`: Solana transaction hash for the payment (Text)

This structure allows for efficient storage and retrieval of order information, enabling features like order history and status tracking.

## Deployment
